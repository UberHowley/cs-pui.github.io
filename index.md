## Why I list CS jobs for Undergraduate Institutions
- **If you would like to a department's listing to this page, [please click  here for instructions](guide.html)**

In 2017, I [wrote an article about finding academic happiness on the job market](https://medium.com/bucknell-hci/the-jobs-i-didnt-see-my-misconceptions-of-the-academic-job-market-9cb98b057422) and why I chose [Bucknell](http://www.eg.bucknell.edu/~emp017/). Since then, I continue to receive emails with the same follow-up question: _how do I find these jobs?_ This listing of schools for the 2020/21 hiring season in CS is meant to help navigate that muddy water. To see last year's list, [visit the Medium article](https://medium.com/@evanmpeck/cs-academic-job-market-for-liberal-arts-colleges-19-20-cd348423f919).

### My criteria for colleges/universities on this page
This document does not contain all or even most CS positions. Instead it targets jobs that I think will align with a specific set of values for some graduate students - those who want to invest in teaching/mentorship with undergrads while still staying active in their scholarship. My criteria:
- Tenure-track positions accessible to those with a Ph.D. in CS
- Universities that identify as **primarily-undergraduate colleges and universities**. No Ph.D. programs. Limited masters (if any).
- Institutions that heavily value teaching, but are also in a position to secure time and financial resources for faculty to remain engaged with research. This typically means a reduced teaching load (often 2/2 or 3/2) with travel and start-up funds.

I'm going to be more flexible in this criteria in 20/21 - partially because the job market looks to be more challenging, but also because I feel uncomfortable acting as a filter to departments who see themselves as aligned with these goals (who am I to say otherwise?).
